AWS FRAUD DETECTION CODETHON ARCHITECTURE

===============================================================================
OVERVIEW
===============================================================================
A comprehensive, serverless fraud detection system built on AWS that processes 
transaction data, detects anomalies using machine learning, and provides an 
intelligent AI assistant for fraud investigation.

===============================================================================
ARCHITECTURE FLOW
===============================================================================
Raw Data (S3) → Glue ETL → SageMaker RCF → Anomaly Scores → Lambda → DynamoDB → AI Assistant

===============================================================================
CORE COMPONENTS
===============================================================================

1. DATA PIPELINE
   - S3 Bucket: Stores raw transaction data, cleaned datasets, and ML model artifacts
   - AWS Glue: ETL job cleans and transforms transaction data from CSV to Parquet format
   - Data Flow: input/ → cleaned/ → rcf-input/ → scored/ → models/

2. MACHINE LEARNING
   - SageMaker Random Cut Forest: Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm
   - Training: Processes 4 features (amount, hour, country, category)
   - Batch Transform: Scores all transactions for anomaly detection
   - Model Storage: Trained models saved to S3 for reuse

3. ALERT PROCESSING
   - Lambda Function: Processes anomaly scores and filters transactions with score > 2.5
   - DynamoDB: Stores fraud alerts with transaction details and risk scores
   - Real-time Processing: Automated alert generation and storage

4. AI ASSISTANT (FRAUDINVESTIGATOR)
   - Lambda Backend: Natural language processing for fraud queries
   - API Gateway: RESTful API for web interface access
   - Web Interface: Beautiful, responsive chat-style UI for investigators
   - Capabilities: Query fraud patterns, explain transactions, generate reports

5. INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE
   - Terraform: Complete infrastructure provisioning and management
   - IAM Roles: Secure, least-privilege access controls
   - Monitoring: CloudWatch logs and metrics for all services

===============================================================================
KEY FEATURES
===============================================================================
- Serverless Architecture: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use model
- Real-time Detection: Sub-minute fraud alert generation
- Natural Language Interface: Ask questions in plain English
- Comprehensive Security: Encryption, IAM roles, VPC isolation
- Production Ready: Complete monitoring, logging, and error handling

===============================================================================
SAMPLE DATA FLOW
===============================================================================
1. 200 sample transactions uploaded to S3
2. Glue job cleans and processes data
3. SageMaker trains RCF model and scores transactions
4. Lambda filters high-risk transactions (5 alerts generated)
5. DynamoDB stores fraud alerts with risk scores 2.8-5.7
6. AI assistant provides intelligent analysis and recommendations

BUSINESS VALUE
===============================================================================
This architecture demonstrates enterprise-grade fraud detection using modern 
AWS services with intelligent automation and user-friendly interfaces. It 
provides real-time fraud detection, reduces false positives, and enables 
investigators to quickly analyze suspicious activities through natural 
language queries.

The system is designed for scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness, 
making it suitable for production deployment in financial institutions and 
e-commerce platforms.
